# alarm_button
Arduino project for a contact sensor state machine with single/double/long press output

Not much to this one, read the comments for configuring the board's capacitive sensor and output pins.  Used the Arduino IDE to develop/deploy, and an optocoupler to interface with a raspberry pi.
